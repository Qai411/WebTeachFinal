        <h1>Animal Ally Web App</h1>
        <p>
            A generic Web application used to manage animals records in the zoo. It allows for one person to manage multiple aspects of the company's business model, mostly keeping records up to date
        </p>

        <h1>What we do</h1>
        <p>
            We provide the Zoo Manager details of the animal population mix, type of animal, and their health condition. We also provide predicted amount of feed in stock for the animals, and the acres of land used for infrastructure.
        </p>
